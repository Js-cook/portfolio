                <p>The following are skills that I find to be most essential in how I navigate academics and team environments.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Time Management: </b> as someone who participates in multiple clubs with high commitment standards while balancing coursework and exams, I consider myself to be very effective at managing time and achieving deadlines.</li>
                    <li><b>Work Ethic: </b> I continually strive for greatness within the classroom and outside, making the dean's list every semester I've attended OSU and being one of the top men's varsity rowers on OSU's club rowing team.</li>
                    <li><b>Teamwork: </b> I have experience working on software-focused and non-software-focused projects throughout my coursework and participate in club rowing, a notably team-centric sport.</li>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>The following are projects that I have undertaken as a part of my coursework or in my spare time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/Js-cook/ENGR-1282-robot-firmware-B5">Robot Firmware</a></h4></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Time of Undertaking/Completion: </b> Second semester Honors Fundamentals of Engineering course</li>
                        <li><b>Language(s)/Tech Used: </b>Firmware was written in C/C++ using a library for interfacing with the microcontroller</li>
                        <li><b>The Problem: </b> The robot designed by my team had to be able to complete various tasks around an obstacle course in the shortest amount of time possible</li>
                        <li><b>The Software Development Process: </b> I took a primarily leadership oriented role during this project as the only CSE major in my group and took this into consideration when designing the firmware so that it would be readable and digestible from a variety of tech backgrounds.</li>
                        <li><b>The Outcome: </b> Robots across different sections of the course competed in an elimination bracket and my team reached the quarterfinals before being eliminated due to hardware malfunction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/Js-cook/Cook-AU24-Component">Java Component</a></h4></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Time of Undertaking/Completion: </b> Third Semester Software II Course</li>
                        <li><b>Language(s)/Tech Used: </b>Java</li>
                        <li><b>The Problem: </b> Open-ended project but the designed component had to follow course rules (avoiding aliasing and null references primarily) and a given project structure</li>
                        <li><b>The Software Development Process: </b> Project was planned methodically and features interfaces, an abstract class, and a full JUnit test suite to allow for dynamic and flexible usage and implementation. The project was also completed over the course of the whole semester incorporating peer and professor feedback.</li>
                        <li><b>The Outcome: </b> I designed a component that could take in coordinate pairs and perform basic statistical computations on the pairs such as sample averages, sample minimums and maximums, sample standard deviation, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/Js-cook/carpool-generator">Carpool Generator</a></h4></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Time of Undertaking/Completion: </b> Personal project completed during winter break between my 3rd and 4th semester</li>
                        <li><b>Language(s)/Tech Used: </b>Vite, React, and Open Route Service's public API hosted with Vercel</li>
                        <li><b>The Problem: </b> Creating carpools for rowing practice is often a time-intensive task and must take in a variety of different factors which this project aims to address using ORS's vehicle route optimization API endpoints</li>
                        <li><b>The Software Development Process: </b> Relatively informal design process that took place over the course of a few weeks but taught me a lot about tools like Vercel and designing production-quality software.</li>
                        <li><b>The Outcome: </b> The site was successfully deployed (can be found <a href="https://carpool-generator.vercel.app/">here</a>) and is awaiting possible use for practice carpools next semester.</li>
